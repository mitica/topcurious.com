The average adult brain weighs about 1.36 kilograms (3 pounds). Despite its relatively small size, the brain uses about 20% of the body's energy.

### 2. The Brain Contains Approximately 86 Billion Neurons

Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system. They transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells.

### 3. The Brain Can't Feel Pain

While the brain might be the pain-processing center when you cut your finger or burn yourself, the brain itself does not have pain receptors and cannot feel pain.

### 4. The Brain is 60% Fat

Making it the fattiest organ in the body. This high fat content is essential for brain functionality, structure, and neurodevelopment.

### 5. Your Brain Generates About 12-25 Watts of Electricity

This is enough to power a low-wattage LED light. This power comes from the 100 billion microcomputer-like cells in our brain firing 200 times per second.

### 6. Brain Information Travels Up To an Estimated 268 mph

This speed is faster than Formula 1 race cars which top out at 240 mph.

### 7. The Human Brain is the Largest Brain of All Vertebrates Relative to Body Size

It makes up about 2% of a human's body weight.

### 8. The Brain's Storage Capacity is Considered Virtually Unlimited

It doesn't get 'used up' like RAM in your computer.

### 9. More Electrical Impulses Are Generated in One Day By a Single Human Brain Than By All the Telephones in The World

This gives you an idea of the brain's immense processing power.

### 10. The Brain is Capable of Surviving for 5 to 6 Minutes Only if It Doesn't Receive Oxygen

After which it begins to die. The effect of brain death is considered irreversible.
